# U.S. States Game


# About the project

Developed in Python during the 'Master Python by Building 100 Projects' course, the 'US States Game' is more than just a game. It's an opportunity to learn about the geography of the United States, practice typing, and improve your knowledge. By creating your own interactive map, you'll be taking an important step towards mastering the location of the American states.

To play, simply enter the name of the state you're remembering. If you want to exit, type "Exit" and a csv file with the names of the unfilled states will be created to help you study.
